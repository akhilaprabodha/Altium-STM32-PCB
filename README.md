# Embedded System Design with Altium Designer

This repository contains the source files and documentation for an embedded system design tutorial using Altium Designer. The tutorial focuses on designing a PCB for an STM32-based embedded system, covering project creation, schematic creation, and library management.

## Overview
The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to designing an embedded system PCB using Altium Designer. It covers the following key aspects:

1. **Project Creation:** Explains how to create a new project in Altium Designer, including setting up project parameters and organizing project files.

2. **Schematic Creation:** Describes the process of creating a schematic for the embedded system, including adding components, connecting nets, and organizing the schematic for clarity.

3. **Libraries:** Discusses library management in Altium Designer, including using built-in libraries, creating custom libraries, and importing manufacturer part libraries.

4. **Component Selection:** Guides the selection of components for the embedded system design, including microcontrollers, sensors, regulators, and connectors.

5. **PCB Layout:** Provides insights into PCB layout considerations, including placement of components, routing of traces, and ensuring signal integrity.

6. **Tooling Holes:** Covers the addition of tooling holes to the PCB layout for manufacturing purposes.
